Using Python to find time-like closed curves (CTCs). ‚è≥ 
In this project (Tipler Cylinder Simulation), I explored the theoretical possibility of Closed Timelike Curves (CTCs) using Python. CTC General Relativity has interesting ideas that could allow time to travel back in time.
The code examines the conditions under which a CTC forms around a rotating cylinder by considering factors such as angular velocity, density, length, and radius. It can be this: 
Check CTC creation: Examine the user-supplied parameters to see if they meet the theoretical threshold for CTC creation. 
Calculate the Riemann Curvature Tensor: This tensor gives insight into the nature of spacetime around a cylinder. I used a representation of the tensor to aid the analysis. Check robustness: The rule checks whether a theoretical CTC is stable or prone to crashes. 
Assume CTC and time-warping effects: If it is possible to create a CTC, the code generates a visualization of possible CTC regions and how nearby time would appear distorted. 
Optimize parameters: The code includes a placeholder function to find parameter optimizations to maximize CTC creativity (current example simplified). 
Although CTCs are still theoretical, this work provides a glimpse into exploring sophisticated aspects of general relativity using Python and Machine Learning.
